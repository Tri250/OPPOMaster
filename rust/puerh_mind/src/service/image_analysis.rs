//! Image analysis task domain — provider trait, mock provider, code-owned JSON
//! Schemas, and the validator/normalizer (Phase 5b).
//!
//! This is the provider-independent Alcedo result contract for the two Phase 5
//! remote tasks. The proto messages (`proto/image_analysis.proto`) carry these
//! typed fields on the wire; the code-owned JSON Schemas below are what Phase 5c
//! drivers inject as `response_format: json_schema` and validate provider output
//! against. Provider configs select the *injection mode* (response_format_json_schema,
//! responses_json_schema, ...); they do not define the business fields — these
//! schemas and the proto do.
//!
//! `image_understanding.describe` and `image_rating.score` are distinct contracts:
//! distinct `task_id`s, distinct result message types, distinct domain outcomes.
//! A rating result can never overwrite or be reinterpreted as an understanding
//! result (Phase 5b review focus).
