//! Phase 5c / 6b remote image-analysis HTTP drivers.
//!
//! Each driver implements [`crate::service::image_analysis::ImageAnalysisProvider`]
//! against a specific protocol family's REST API:
//! - [`openai_chat_compatible::OpenAiChatCompatibleProvider`] —
//!   `openai_chat_compatible`, the generic OpenAI Chat-compatible
//!   `/chat/completions` driver (Opencode, OpenRouter, plain OpenAI-compatible
//!   servers). `openrouter::OpenRouterChatProvider` is a type alias for this type;
//!   the `openrouter_chat` driver id dispatches to the same implementation with
//!   OpenRouter's routing/attribution knobs config-gated on.
//! - [`anthropic_messages::AnthropicMessagesProvider`] — `anthropic_messages`, the
//!   generic Anthropic Messages `/messages` driver (Opencode, the real Anthropic
//!   API, the Volcengine Ark Coding Plan).
//! - [`volcengine_ark::VolcengineArkResponsesProvider`] — `volcengine_ark_responses`,
//!   OpenAI Responses-compatible `/api/v3/responses`.
//!
//! All three reuse the shared rustls client, image encoding, bounded retry,
//! strict-schema injection, response-reading, and redaction discipline from
//! [`http_util`]. The drivers are constructed from validated `ProviderConfig`s at
//! startup ([`build_real_image_providers`]); the secret is resolved from the
//! credential vault per request and never travels through args, options, or logs.

/// are wired as of Phase 6b but NOT advertised (models ship unverified, per the
/// Phase 6a advertisement gate). The risk only surfaces for user-supplied configs
